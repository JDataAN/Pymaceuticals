Introduction

 Welcome to the Pymaceuticals SCC Treatment Study repository! This repository houses the code and analysis for a recent animal study investigating potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a prevalent form of skin cancer.

 Study Details

 The study involved administering various drug regimens to 249 mice diagnosed with SCC tumors. Tumor development was monitored and measured over 45 days. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Pymaceuticals' novel drug, Capomulin, compared to other treatments.

 Data Analysis Goals

 This project aims to generate:

Tables: Summarize key findings from the study, including tumor volume data and potential outliers.
Figures: Visualize the distribution of tumor volume across treatment groups using boxplots.
Summary Report: Provide a concise overview of the study results, highlighting significant observations regarding Capomulin's performance and potential next steps.
 Code Structure

 The code utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

 Expected Outcome

 This analysis will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of Capomulin and other treatment options for SCC. The findings will be compiled into a comprehensive technical report to inform future clinical trials.

 Next Steps

Analyze treatment efficacy and identify potential outliers in tumor volume data.
Generate tables and figures summarizing key findings.
Draft a comprehensive technical report presenting study results and conclusions.
 Disclaimer

 This README provides a high-level overview of the project. The actual code and scripts performing the analysis are not included in this document for brevity.
